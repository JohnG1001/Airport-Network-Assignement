# Airport-Network-Assignement
The Airport Network Assignment was the introduction to Sets and using them to create a Airport Network and return connections of Airports based on certain distances from each other.

# Disclaimer
The "RoutesPanel" file was created by my professor in order to visually display the airport network for our assignment.

*The Airport Network Assignment was apart of "Data Structures" class at San Jose State university*
